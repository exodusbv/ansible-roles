# Ansible roles

This repository provides a number of Ansible roles, to be included as a git submodule in a project. To do so, do this:

    git submodule add git://github.com/exodusbv/ansible-roles.git roles

See the `playbook.example.yml` file for a small example of using these roles in a playbook.
